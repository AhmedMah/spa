Make more inclusive - "we can" instead of "Qualaroo"

Why should I care?
- "I used SaSS once and it killed my dog" (Louis, Manning reviewer)
-  Island of logic vs. JS-CSS
-  Do the impossible - create a personalized stylesheet
   based on the site, page, browser, device, orientation, and heartbeat.
   ( Just joking about the heartbeat -- but we could! )


Bring hook slide from the bottom...
-----------------------------------
Show click through example FIRST
Show another practical example SECOND
THEN show qualaroo
  - Show examples of different surveys
    (zoomed in on phone, zoomed out, overlay survey, regular survey, etc)
  - Create simple example page to share (MichaelMikowski.com/survey)
  - Put URL on the slide on the slide 

"We spent months developing this technique at Qualaroo before
sharing this with the world."

Rename stylesheet 1 and stylesheet 2

Why create bloated CSS?

Example cascade - software advantage example
Site - Page - Browser - Device - Orientation - Heartbeat
App - Survey - Page - Element
