# Purpose

Provide freely available resources 
discussed in the book Single Page Web applications.

The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
appendix A - Code standards.

# Contribute

I hope to post the full standards here in the near future.
If you want to contribute to a cohesive JS standard, please
issue a pull request or note an issue, and I'd be happy to
collaborate!
