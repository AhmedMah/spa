# Purpose

These are the resources discussed in the book 
**Single Page Web Applications - Javascript End-to-end**.

The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
appendix A - Code standards.

The **listings** directory contains all the source code
from the book - and a few extras!

# Collaborate

The listings are provided for reference and collaboration.  
You are welcome to creat ea fork.  If you use substantially 
the same work in a public project,we would very much appreciate
attribution.

If you improve something, please share by sending a pull request.
If you want something improved, please file a bug.

I hope to post the full standards here in the near future.
This is pending approval by Manning and my co-author.
If you want to contribute to a cohesive JS standard, please
issue a pull request or note an issue, and I'd be happy to
collaborate.
