# Purpose

Provide freely available resources 
discussed in the book Single Page Web applications.

The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
appendix A - Code standards.

The *listings* directory contains all the source code
from the book.

# Contribute

The listings are available for forking for your development.
If you improve something, please share by sending a pull request.
If you want something improved, you could also file a bug.

I hope to post the full standards here in the near future.
This is pending approval by Manning and my co-author.
If you want to contribute to a cohesive JS standard, please
issue a pull request or note an issue, and I'd be happy to
collaborate.
