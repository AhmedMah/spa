# Purpose

These are the resources discussed in the book 
**Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end**.

### Source Code

The **listings** directory contains all the source code
from the book - and a few extras!

### Quick Reference

The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
**Appendix A - Code standards**.

## jQuery Plugins

If you are looking jQuery plugins, you may look at my other public
GitHub repositories.  A quick list can be found
[on the plugin site](http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowskihttp://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowski).

# Collaborate

### Listings

The listings are provided for reference and collaboration.
You are welcome to create a fork. If you use substantially
the same work in a public project, we would very much appreciate
attribution.

If you improve something, please share by sending a pull request.
If you want something improved, please file a bug.

### Standards

I hope to post the full standards here in the near future so that
they may be continually updated by the community.
This is pending approval by Manning and my co-author.
